# 8-ball-pool-bot [WIP]
A bot for Miniclip's 8 Ball Pool web app.

After manually labelling like a thousand pool balls lol I was able to calculate the centres with ML reasonably accurately (much better than generic OpenCV circle detection).
Given this, I was able to determine ball positions to calculate and project lines.
Still need to develop an algorithm to the determine best shot given these projections.
Then write code to actually perform the shot.

Super busy atm but maybe one day I'll come back to it.
